# C_&_C++_ProgrammingFundamentals
***Introduction to C programming, and Analysis and design of C++ OOP programs.***



## Introduction to C Programming
The "Introduction to C Programming" course serves as a fundamental stepping stone for aspiring programmers. C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is essential for understanding low-level programming concepts, memory management, and the efficient use of system resources. This course lays the groundwork for more advanced programming languages and concepts by teaching students how to write, compile, and debug C programs. It covers key topics such as data types, control structures, functions, and arrays, which are crucial for developing a solid programming foundation. Mastery of C programming is invaluable for those looking to delve into systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

## Analysis and Design of C++ OOP Programs
The "Analysis and Design of C++ OOP Programs" course builds upon the foundational knowledge gained from C programming, introducing the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. This course emphasizes the importance of designing robust, reusable, and maintainable code through the application of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Students learn to analyze and design complex software systems using C++ by employing techniques such as class diagrams, design patterns, and software architecture principles. The course also focuses on implementing real-world applications that demonstrate the practical benefits of OOP, such as improved code organization, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

#Repository Overview
My repository contains a comprehensive collection of practical exercises, assignments, and projects developed during the courses. These resources provide a hands-on approach to learning and applying programming concepts. Notably, the "AppliedGame_JEVG" project in the "Analysis and Design of C++ OOP Programs" course is a culmination of the learned OOP principles, integrating various topics into a cohesive program. This project exemplifies the ability to design and implement a complete application, showcasing the practical application of theoretical knowledge.
